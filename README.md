# Multi-Core Computing
* The projects involve analysis of complex algorithms implemented in a concurrent environment. To make our analysis more efficient we use a number of high performance clusters from TACC.
# Texas Advanced Computing Centre
* The Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) designs and operates some of the world's most powerful computing resources. The center's mission is to enable discoveries that advance science and society through the application of advanced computing technologies


# A comparison of Peterson and Lamport's Bakery Algorithms
* Lonestar 5 is a high performance computing system deployed at TACC for use by academic researchers in Austin and across Texas. It serves as the primary advanced computing resource in the University of Texas Research Cyberinfrastructure (UTRC) initiative, sponsored by The University of Texas System, as well as for partner institutions Texas Tech University and Texas A&M University.
